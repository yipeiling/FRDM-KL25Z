# FRDM-KL25Z


A domain specific language (DSL) by Haskell for children programming FRDM-KL25Z
Due to the limited existence of children text programming language, this project will present the
design and implement a domain specific language (DSL) by Haskell for children programming
FRDM-KL25Z. The target user for this DSL is mostly children with ages starting from 9 years old.
This work will increase productivity and simplify the software development process. 
FRDMKL25Z is a cheap, mature and good-interactive program board. In my opinion, it is a good
example to teach children some high-level computer science concepts.
